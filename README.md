# pyJanus

Janus is a Dynamic Aerospace Vehicle Exchange Mark-up Language (DAVE-ML) C++ Interpreter.

This repository contains python wrappers for the Janus library, a supporting library called Ute, and example use cases.

## Installation

pyJanus can be installed directly from [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-janus) pre-built wheels using:

```console
pip install python-janus
```

## Resources

- DST Group Janus website: <https://www.dst.defence.gov.au/opportunity/janus-dynamic-aerospace-vehicle-exchange-mark-language-dave-ml-c-interpreter>

- DAVE-ML website: <http://daveml.org/intro.html>

## Build

From within the top-level directory you can instal pyJanus with pip:

```console
export MAKEFLAGS=-j8
pip install --verbose .[test]
```

To run tests, run `python -m pytest --verbose`

If you wish to only compile the binary `pyJanus.pyd`, you can run:

```console
mkdir build
cmake . -B build -DBUILD_PYBINDINGS=ON -DPY_VERSION_INFO=dev -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON
cmake --build build -j8 --config Release
```

See [build.md](./BUILD.md) for other options such as building only the Janus library.
